This Capstone Project envisions the automation of planting using technology. 
The Smart Plant helps plant growers track and monitor their plants daily and 
provides an efficient system for plants to grow and sustain the healthy plant. 
Using sensors such as Temperature, Humidity, and soil moisture allow users to 
maintain the health of the plant through an application, providing notifications 
for health updates or maintenance requirements.
